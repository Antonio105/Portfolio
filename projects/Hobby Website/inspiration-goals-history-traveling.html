    <p>I will definitely never stop traveling, it's one of my favorite things I look forward to because I get to connect with so many people. The one problem is that as I get older, the less time I have to travel but that just makes me appreciate it just that much more. I hope to one day travel all over Europe and get to explore other places I've never seen.</p>

    <p>Traveling has always existed but the way we do it now is much more efficient. Believe me I'd rather drive a car than ride a horse for months. Not only can it be a fun time, but it can also be a way to learn more about history and the rest of the world.</p>
