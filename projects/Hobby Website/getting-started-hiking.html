<article class="box">
    <p>I started hiking for the same reason everyone else does. To get some exercise and to see some wonderful views of Arizona. Hiking is also really fun to do with family and friends since you get to have nice, genuine conversations with everyone.</p>

    <p>One thing to keep in mind if you are also interested in hiking, is to be safe and hydrated at all times! Heat strokes are very common in Arizona and it's a very dangerous situation to be hiking and then being in need of medical assistance. But besides that, pick a mountain or any kind of trail and start walking till you can't anymore.</p>
