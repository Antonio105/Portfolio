<article class="box">
    <p>Simple really, I developed a passion for playing games when I was still living in Mexico. It would rain all the time where I use to live and I would have anything to do. Eventually my mom bought me my first console, the <em>"Nintendo GameCube"</em>. After that, I started accumulating almost every console overtime which led me to being the full fledged gamer I am now. Around the year 2015 was when I first switched to PC and I havent looked back since.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in playing any kind of game, go for it! All you need to become a gamer is a game, and your imagination. Gaming is one of the funnest things I do and I wouldnt trade it for anything.</p>
