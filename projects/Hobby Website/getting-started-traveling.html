<article class="box">
    <p>I enjoy traveling so much because it usually means I get to see family and I've been doing it since I can remember. Originally I was born in Pennsylvania, but my parents and I moved to Mexico when I was about 8 months old. The time I spent living there was always greeted with flights back to the U.S. to visit my family. My brother now lives in Chicago and my sister lives in Florida. Which means I have family all over the world and the culture is very different. Thanks to everyone around me I get to travel often and it's a blast.</p>

    <p>Traveling is only a matter of picking a destation and going there. Bringing or meeting friends and family only adds to the fun and can be a good break from normal work life. Just make sure you're accommodated anywhere you go and things can only go right if you are careful.</p>
