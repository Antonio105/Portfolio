    <p>As much as I love hiking in the mountains, I do plan on moving away to college and there will most likely not be many mountains... But, almost anywhere I can go there will be walking trails and much more. Hiking doesn't have to just be in the mountains, it can be anywhere honestly as long as there is a destination.</p>

    <p>People have been hiking since the very beginning of time. There wasn't much transportation in those times so sometimes people had to hike to get where they needed to be. Nowadays it is more of a hobby, but I enjoy doing it for sport and it's a great way for anyone to relax and breathe some fresh air.</p>
