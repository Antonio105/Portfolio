I currently live in Arizona and I'm a Junior in high school. My greatest strengths are multitasking and cooperative teamwork as my current goal is to study Software Engineering. Throughout high school I have stayed connected by involving my self in wrestling and participated in clubs such as FBLA earning multiple awards. As a result, I have learned important leadership skills that will support me in my ability to pursue my career goals.</p>
